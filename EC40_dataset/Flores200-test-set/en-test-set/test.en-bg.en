In Berlin , police estimated 6,500 protestors .
Protests also took place in Paris , Sofia in Bulgaria , Vilnius in Lithuania , Valetta in Malta , Tallinn in Estonia , and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland .
In London , about 200 people protested outside some major copyright holders ' offices .
Last month , there were major protests in Poland when that country signed ACTA , which has led to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement , for now .
Latvia and Slovakia have both delayed the process of joining ACTA .
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) are again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian abattoirs .
RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O 'Shannessy told the ABC that surveillance and inspections of abattoirs should be commonplace in Australia .
" The CCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those people working with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority . "
The United States Geological Survey international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the week prior .
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours .
The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano 's summit caldera .
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain .
The clouds presented the potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had taken place .

A former student said that he ' used slang in class , taught dating skills in notes , and was just like the students ' friend . ' 
During the last three decades , despite officially remaining a communist state , China has developed a market economy .
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping .
Since then , China 's economic size has grown by 90 times .
For the first time , last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the biggest market for this industry .
China 's GDP could be larger than the United States within two decades .
Tropical Storm Danielle , fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean .
The storm , located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami , Florida , has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 64 kph ) .
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday .
As the storm is far from landfall , it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean .

" Luckily nothing happened to me , but I saw a macabre scene , as people tried to break windows in order to get out .
People were hitting the panes with chairs , but the windows were unbreakable .
One of the panes finally broke , and they started to get out by the window , " said survivor Franciszek Kowal .
Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged ( or fused ) together to form heavier elements .
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way .
This , however , is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built .
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension .
Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them .
The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water 's surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water .
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them . The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice , even when tilted .
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved , as the blade tilts to one side or the other , the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves .
This causes the skater to turn . If the skates tilt to the right , the skater turns right , if the skates tilt to the left , the skater turns left .
To return to their previous energy level , they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light .
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a " photon . "
Scientists call this process " stimulated emission of radiation " because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light , causing the emission of a photon of light , and light is a type of radiation .
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons . Of course , in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture .
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms !
After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works .
The light bulb then needs replacing . It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb .
First , the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected .
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket .
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart , which pumps the blood .
Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart in tubes called veins . The smallest tubes are called capillaries .
A triceratops ' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots .
Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads , which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous .
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp , spiky leaves .
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk .
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them , even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot ( a descendant of the dinosaurs ) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit .
How would Io 's gravity pull on me ? If you stood on the surface of Io , you would weigh less than you do on Earth .
A person who weighs 200 pounds ( 90kg ) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds ( 16kg ) on Io . So the gravity , of course , pulls less on you .
The Sun doesn 't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on . The whole Sun is made out of gases , fire , and plasma .
The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun .
The outer @-@ part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere , which means " ball of light . "
About three thousand years later , in 1610 , Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases , just as the moon does .
Phases happen because only the side of Venus ( or of the Moon ) facing the Sun is lighted . The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun .
Then , a few years later in 1639 , an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus .
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw .
However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum 's a century earlier .
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson , a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination .
After initial military setbacks , Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf , who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success .
Hangeul is the only purposely invented alphabet in popular daily use . The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong ( 1418 - 1450 ) .
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded .
He originally named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum , which means " the correct sounds for the instruction of the people . "
There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence . One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them .
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe .
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit . After the compilation of Upanishads , Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy .
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language , which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages , just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish .
With the battle for France over , Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain .
Germany code @-@ named the attack " Operation Sealion . " Most of the British Army 's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk , so the army was fairly weak .
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ( " Kriegsmarine " ) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel .
However , very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack .
Let 's start with an explanation about Italy 's plans . Italy was mainly the " little brother " of Germany and Japan .
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy , although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war .
Italy 's main goals were African countries . To capture those countries , they would need to have a troop launching pad , so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa .
For that , they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt . Besides those actions , Italy 's battleships were not supposed to do anything else .
Now for Japan . Japan was an island country , just like Britain .
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater , and remain there for an extended amount of time .
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II . Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range .
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea , but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen .
German submarines were called U @-@ Boats . The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines .
Because of their success with submarines , after the war Germans aren 't trusted to have many of them .
Yes ! King Tutankhamun , sometimes referred to as " King Tut " or " The Boy King , " is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times .
Interestingly , he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists .
However , the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity . While many tombs of the past were robbed , this tomb was left virtually undisturbed .
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved , including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones .
The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter , faster , and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots .
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers . About 1000 B.C. , the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry .
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback . The saddle had not yet been invented , so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses .
We know many Greek politicians , scientists , and artists . Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer , the legendary blind poet , who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature : the poems Iliad and Odyssey .
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature .
Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras , mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles .
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi . It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world .
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted .
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers , and as many as 800 million people can understand the language .
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script ; in everyday conversations , speakers of both languages can usually understand each other .
Around the 15th century , northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany .
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people , so they invented the Estonian literal language .
It was based on the German alphabet and one character " Õ / õ " was added .
As time passed , many words that were borrowed from German coalesced . This was the beginning of enlightenment .
Traditionally , the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school .
However , Charles went to university at Trinity College , Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology , and later History , earning a 2 : 2 ( a lower second class degree ) .
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree .
European Turkey ( eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula ) includes 3 % of the country .
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres ( 1,000 mi ) long and 800 km ( 500 mi ) wide , with a roughly rectangular shape .
Turkey 's area , including lakes , occupies 783,562 square kilometres ( 300,948 sq mi ) , of which 755,688 square kilometres ( 291,773 sq mi ) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres ( 9,174 sq mi ) in Europe .
Turkey 's area makes it the world 's 37th @-@ largest country , and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined .
Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides : the Aegean Sea to the west , the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south .
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates from 1839 .
Present @-@ day parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the 1830s Belgian Revolution .
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but it was occupied in both World War I and World War II by Germany .
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization which is today known as the European Union .
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District ( in Phondey Village ) .
It is said that in 1649 , Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan @-@ Mongol forces .
In 1951 , a fire caused for only some of the relics of the Drukgyal Dzong to remain , such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal .
After the fire , the fortress was preserved and protected , remaining to be one of Bhutan 's most sensational attractions .
During the 18th century Cambodia found itself squeezed between two powerful neighbors , Thailand and Vietnam .
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen .
In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia .
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed , and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy .
Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector , nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture .
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil , where the country is a net exporter , even though only one percent work in the oil industry .
Early in the nation 's independence , Singapore Botanic Gardens ' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City .

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills , as well as tools mastered in interactive classes ( storyboarding , audio and video editing , story telling , etc . )
Interactive design requires that you re @-@ assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non @-@ linear ways .
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other , but also make sense as a separate entity .
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses .
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production .
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length .
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture ( the speed ) of the lens is usually lower .
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low @-@ light conditions without a flash .
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan .
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public .
For that reason , everything you see on the TV had the borders cut , top , bottom and sides .
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen . That is called overscan .
Unfortunately , when you make a DVD , it 's borders will most likely be cut too , and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom , they won 't be fully shown .
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination , conjuring up images of jousts , banquets and Arthurian chivalry .
Even standing amidst thousand year @-@ old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone , to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits .
But is our imagination based on reality ? Why were castles built in the first place ? How were they designed and built ?
Typical for the period , Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle .
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long .
In the 1480s , when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings , the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders .
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states .
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful , and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance .
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power .
This marked an important change , as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars . Thus , the Thirty Years ' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war .
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21 , 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus .
According to the story , his motivation was fame at any cost . The Ephesians , outraged , announced that Herostratus ' name never be recorded .
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name , which is how we know today . The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born .
Alexander , as king , offered to pay to rebuild the temple , but his offer was denied . Later , after Alexander died , the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE .
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers .
This way , you will tire yourself out as little as possible . Remember there 's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano .
On the accordion , to get extra volume , you use the bellows with more pressure or speed .
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with , identity with , or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality , divinity , spiritual truth , or God .
The believer seeks a direct experience , intuition , or insight into divine reality / the deity or dieties .
Followers pursue certain ways of living , or practices that are intended to nurture those experiences .
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness , particularly those of a peaceful , insightful , blissful , or even ecstatic character .
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub @-@ continent . It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition .
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions .
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat , which is Punjabi for " way of the guru . " The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs .
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak ( 1469 @-@ 1539 ) . There followed in succession a further nine gurus .
However , in June 1956 , Krushchev 's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland , where workers were protesting against food shortages and wage cuts , turned into a general protest against Communism .
Although in the end , Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order , he did give way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister .
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent encompassing most of modern @-@ day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan .
The civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River wherefore it derives its name .
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilisation also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River , it should be aptly called the Indus @-@ Sarasvati Civilization , while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa , the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s .
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire aided in the development of medical advances .
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of battles .
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbane seeds .
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as tourniquets and arterial clamps to stem blood flow .
Over multiple centuries , the Roman empire led to great gains in the field of medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today .
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be done at a time , more complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed , and all folds have straightforward locations .
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills .
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young and these racial stereotypes affect behavior .
For instance , children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race .
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently .
These websites have gotten a lot of attention , especially in the education setting .
There are positive aspects to these websites , which include , being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs , videos , photos , and other features .
This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address , which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling .
It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as desired .
Attention Deficit Disorder " is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity , distractibility , and hyperactivity or excess energy . "
It is not a learning disability , it is a learning disorder ; it " affects 3 to 5 percent of all children , perhaps as many as 2 million American children . "
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work , but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation .
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble , because they " engage in risky behaviors , get into fights , and challenge authority " in order to stimulate their brain , since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods .
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different .
As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed .
The approach to obtaining information was different . No longer did pressure reside within individual recall , but the ability to recall text became more of a focus .
In essence , the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge .
Unlike other primates , hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or bearing weight or swinging through the trees .
The chimpanzee 's hand and foot are similar in size and length , reflecting the hand 's use for bearing weight in knuckle walking .
The human hand is shorter than the foot , with straighter phalanges .
Fossil hand bones two million to three million years old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation .
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting .
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states .
With fewer REMs per night , this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem .
This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV .
The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night .
Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start . Within a week of Italy 's declaration of war on June 10 , 1940 , the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya .
In an ambush east of Bardia , the British captured the Italian Tenth Army 's Engineer @-@ in @-@ Chief , General Lastucci .
On June 28 , Marshal Italo Balbo , the Governor @-@ General of Libya and apparent heir to Mussolini , was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk .
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels , from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition .
The sport is primarily played in a duel format , one fencer dueling another .
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls into holes .
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round , with players usually starting on the first hole on the course and finishing on the eighteenth .
The player who takes the fewest strokes , or swings of the club , to complete the course wins .
The game is played on grass , and the grass around the hole is mown shorter and called the green .
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling : Recreation tourism .
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day @-@ to @-@ day life to relax and have fun .
Beaches , theme parks and camp grounds are often the most common places frequented by recreational tourists .
If the objective of one 's visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism .
Tourists may visit different landmarks of a particular country or they may simply opt to focus on just one area .
The Colonists , seeing this activity , had also called for reinforcements .
Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men , under Colonels John Stark and James Reed ( both later became generals ) .
Stark 's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist 's position .
When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula , they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water 's edge on a small beach .
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet ( 30 m ) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it .
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions .
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown , in order to block off any reinforcements .
General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry , seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping .
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton , and then split into two groups , one under Greene and one under Sullivan , in order to launch a pre @-@ dawn attack .
With the change from the quarter to the half mile run , speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity .
Of course a first @-@ class half @-@ miler , a man who can beat two minutes , must be possessed of a fair amount of speed , but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards .
Some cross country running during the winter , combined with gymnasium work for the upper part of the body , is the best preparation for the running season .
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot generate elite performances , but they can significantly affect young athletes ' overall wellness .
Maintaining a healthy energy balance , practicing effective hydration habits , and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of the sport .
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport ; however , there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment required to participate .
Products can be purchased as needed , but most will have little or no real impact on performance .
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it provides no real benefits .
The atom can be considered to be one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter .
Its a very complex entity which consists , according to a simplified Bohr model , of a central nucleus orbited by electrons , somewhat similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1 .
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons .
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge . The electrons have a negative electric charge .
To Check the victim , you must first survey the scene to ensure your safety .
You need to notice the victim 's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags .
If you get hurt trying to help , you may only serve to make matters worse .
The study found that depression , fear and catastrophising mediated the relationship between pain and disability in lower back pain sufferers .
Only the effects of catastrophizing , not depression and fear was conditional of regular weekly structured PA sessions .
Those participating in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain distinguishing the differences of chronic pain and discomfort feel from normal physical movement .
Vision , or the ability to see depends on visual system sensory organs or eyes .
There are many different constructions of eyes , ranging in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism .
The different constructions have different capabilities , are sensitive to different wave @-@ lengths and have differing degrees of acuity , also they require different processing to make sense of the input and different numbers to work optimally .
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographic area .
When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait they are known as monomorphic .
When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are polymorphic .
Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well .
In the nomadic phase , army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day .
The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased . During this phase , the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday .
Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days .
What is a cell ? The word cell comes from the Latin word " cella , " meaning " small room , " and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork .
The cell is the basic unit of all living things , and all organisms are composed of one or more cells .
Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life , in fact , that they are often referred to as " the building blocks of life . "
The Nervous System maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through out the body to keep the flow of blood going as well as undisturbed .
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body which helps keep the body safe from any potential threat .
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms , but they can destroy everything in their path .
Tornadoes uproot trees , rip boards from buildings , and fling cars up into the sky . The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours .
These monster storms have winds up to 480 km / h ( 133 m / s ; 300 mph ) .
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years .
However , the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century .
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger .
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly
Hopefully , most people will realise that their long term best option is to work together with others .
Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds , some people wonder what 's out there some belive that aliens or other life may live on another plant .
But , if this ever does happen probably won 't happen for a very long time . The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of miles between stars that are " neighbors . "
Maybe one day , your great grandchildren will be standing atop an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors ?
Animals are made of many cells . They eat things and digest them inside . Most animals can move .
Only animals have brains ( though not even all animals do ; jellyfish , for example , do not have brains ) .
Animals are found all over the earth . They dig in the ground , swim in the oceans , and fly in the sky .
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living ( things ) organism .
Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room .
If you look at living things under a microscope , you will see that they are made of small squares or balls .
Robert Hooke , a biologist from England , saw small squares in cork with a microscope .
They looked like rooms . He was the first person to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another and not change .
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen . The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same .
Water is another example . The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom .
It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas , liquid , or solid .
Although its physical state may change , its chemical state remains the same .
Time is something that is all around us , and affects everything we do , yet is difficult to understand .
Time has been studied by religious , philosophical , and scientific scholars for thousands of years .
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past .
Time is also how we compare the duration ( length ) of events .
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event . A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly .
Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos .
Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers , and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films .
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together .
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people , who hunted giant birds called moas .
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori , establishing an agricultural society .
However , new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands , developing their own distinctive , peaceful culture .
There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand .
They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end , the Moriori were wiped out
Individuals who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while candidly assessing difficulties and even failures .
While listening to individuals share their individual , family , and organizational stories , we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities who influenced for good or ill the culture of the organization .
While understanding one 's history does not assume understanding of culture , it does at least help people gain a sense of where they fall within the history of the organization .
While assessing the successes and becoming aware of failures , individuals and the whole of the participating persons discover more deeply the values , mission , and driving forces of the organization .
In this instance , recalling previous instances of entrepreneurial behavior and resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church .
Such success stories lessened the fears of change , while creating positive inclinations toward change in the future .
Convergent thinking patterns are problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution .
The focus of this mindset is speed , logic and accuracy , also identification of facts , reapplying existing techniques , gathering information .
The most important factor of this mindset is : there is only one correct answer . You only think of two answers , namely right or wrong .
This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard procedures .
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking , are able to memorize patterns , solve problems and work on scientific tests .
Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others .
That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive , intend , believe , know or desire .
Among these abilities , understanding the intention of others is crucial . It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions .
For example , if you were to see someone breaking a car window , you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger 's car .
He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into .
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch ( working at Stanford University ) and Edward Purcell ( from Harvard University ) .
In this resonance , magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals .
In the year 1970 , Raymond Damadian , a medical doctor and research scientist , discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis .
Four years later a patent was granted , which was the world 's first patent issued in the field of MRI .
In 1977 , Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first " whole @-@ body " MRI scanner , which he called the " Indomitable . "
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others .
It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information .
In addition , there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours . ( Bremer , 1998 )
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times .
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses , rather than waiting until the next face @-@ to @-@ face meeting .
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom from absolutes . There is no one good way to learn .
In fact , there is not one good thing to learn.Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented .
Our current experience with all the do @-@ it @-@ yourself and information presenting , learning @-@ based television shows illustrates this point .
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge .
We will never overhaul a car , build a fountain in our backyard , travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins , or remodel our neighbour 's house .
Thanks to undersea fiber optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite , Greenland is well connected with 93 % of the population having internet access .
Your hotel or hosts ( if staying in a guesthouse or private home ) will likely have wifi or an internet connected PC , and all settlements have an internet cafe or some location with public wifi .
As mentioned above , though the word " Eskimo " remains acceptable in the United States , it is considered pejorative by many non @-@ U.S. Arctic peoples , especially in Canada .
While you may hear the word used by Greenlandic Natives , its use should be avoided by foreigners .
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq ( plural Kalaallit ) , a Greenlander , in Greenland .
Crime , and ill @-@ will toward foreigners in general , is virtually unknown in Greenland . Even in the towns , there are no " rough areas . "
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared will face .
If you visit Greenland during cold seasons ( considering that the further north you go , the colder it will be ) , it is essential to bring warm enough clothing .
The very long days in the summer can lead to problems getting sufficient sleep and associated health issues .
During the summer , also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes . Although they do not transmit any diseases , they can be irritating .
While San Francisco 's economy is linked to it being a world @-@ class tourist attraction , its economy is diversified .
The largest employment sectors are professional services , government , finance , trade , and tourism .
Its frequent portrayal in music , films , literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world .
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels , restaurants , and top @-@ notch convention facilities .
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the nation for other Asian cuisine : Korean , Thai , Indian , and Japanese .
Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families .
The " typical " visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport , busing to an on @-@ site Disney hotel , spending about a week without leaving Disney property , and returning home .
There are infinite variations possible , but this remains what most people mean when they talk of " going to Disney World . "
Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi @-@ day park @-@ hopper tickets .
While this is a very common activity , it is prohibited by Disney : the tickets are non @-@ transferable .
Any camping below the rim in Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit .
Permits are limited to protect the canyon , and become available on the 1st day of the month , four months prior to the start month .
Thus , a backcountry permit for any start date in May becomes available on 1 Jan.
Space for the most popular areas , such as the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch , generally fill up by the requests received on first date they are opened to reservations .
There are a limited number permits reserved for walk @-@ in requests available on a first come , first served basis .
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the region 's beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes .
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning but a 4x4 is highly advised and many locations are only accessible with a high wheel base 4x4 .
Keep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighboring countries are .
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and are affected by the country you come from .
Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items need to be in the car .
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe , across the border from Livingstone , Zambia , and near Botswana .
The town lies immediately next to the falls , and they are the major attraction , but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay .
In the rainy season ( November to March ) , the water volume will be higher and the Falls will be more dramatic .
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls .
On the other hand , it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured - by all the water !
Tomb of Tutankhamun ( KV62 ) . KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley , the scene of Howard Carter 's 1922 discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king .
Compared to most of the other royal tombs , however , the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth visiting , being much smaller and with limited decoration .
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the mummy done during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible .
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it , but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo .
Visitors with limited time would be best to spend their time elsewhere .
Phnom Krom , 12 km southwest of Siem Reap . This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 9th century , during the reign of King Yasovarman .
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile .
A visit to the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake .
The Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temple so do not forget to bring your passport along when heading to Tonle Sap .
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel , though most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel 's capital .
The ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years .
The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism , Christianity and Islam , and serves as a spiritual , religious , and cultural center .
Due to the religious significance of the city , and in particular the many sites of the Old City area , Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel .
Jerusalem has many historic , archeological and cultural sites , along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers , cafés , and restaurants .
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter prior to entering Ecuador through international airports or frontier admission points .
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and comply with certain requirements .
These requirements are designed to provide an organized migratory flow between both countries .
Cuban citizens who are US green card holders should visit an Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption to this requirement .
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates . A round / onward trip ticket is needed to prove the length of your stay .
Tours are cheaper for larger groups , so if you 're by yourself or with just one friend , try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a better per @-@ person rate .
However , this shouldn 't really be off your concern , because often tourists are shuffled around to fill the cars .
It seems actually to be more a way of tricking people into believing they have to pay more .
Towering above the north end of Machu Picchu is this steep mountain , often the backdrop to many photos of the ruins .
It looks a bit daunting from below , and it is a steep and difficult ascent , but most reasonably fit persons should be able to make it in about 45 minutes .
Stone steps are laid along most of the path , and in the steeper sections steel cables provide a supporting handrail .
That said , expect to be out of breath , and take care in the steeper portions , especially when wet , as it can become dangerous quickly .
There 's a tiny cave near the top that must be passed through , it is quite low and a rather tight squeeze .
Seeing the sites and wildlife of the Galapagos is best done by boat , just as Charles Darwin did it in 1835 .
Over 60 cruise ships ply the Galapagos waters - ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers .
Most people book their place well in advance ( as the boats are usually full during the high season ) .
Be sure the agent through whom you book is a Galapagos specialist with a good knowledge of a wide variety of ships .
This will ensure that your particular interests and / or constraints are matched with the ship most suitable to them .
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century , northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucanians ( Mapuche ) inhabited central and southern Chile .
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups , that were not fully absorbed into Spanish @-@ speaking rule until after Chile 's independence .
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 ( amid the Napoleonic wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for a couple of years ) , decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818 .
The Dominican Republic ( Spanish : República Dominicana ) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola , which it shares with Haiti
Besides white sand beaches and mountain landscapes , the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas , now part of Santo Domingo .
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes . The Caribes were an Arawakan @-@ speaking people who had arrived around 10,000 BCE .
Within a few short years following the arrival of European explorers , the population of Tainos had significantly been reduced by the Spanish conquerors
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas ( Tratado de las Indias ) between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish conquerors killed around 100,000 Taínos .
Jardín de la Unión . This space was built as the atrium for a 17th @-@ century convent , of which the Templo de San Diego is the sole surviving building .

It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread out over 2.2 million km2 of ocean .
With the same time zone as Hawaii , the islands are sometimes thought of as " Hawaii down under . "
Though smaller , it reminds some elderly visitors of Hawaii before statehood without all the large tourist hotels and other development .
The Cook Islands do not have any cities but are composed of 15 different islands . The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki .
In developed countries today , providing deluxe bed and breakfasts has been raised to a sort of art @-@ form .
At the top end , B & Bs obviously compete mainly on two main things : bedding and breakfast .
Accordingly , at the finest such establishments one is apt to find the most luxurious bedding , maybe a handmade quilt or an antique bed .
Breakfast may include seasonal delights of the region or the host 's speciality dish .
The setting might be an historic old building with antique furnishings , manicured grounds and a swimming pool .
Getting into your own car and heading off on a long road trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity .
Unlike larger vehicles , you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations .
Setting up a tent on private property or in a town of any size can easily attract unwanted attention .
In short , using your car is a great way to take a road trip but seldom in itself a way to " camp . "
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan , SUV , Sedan or Station Wagon with seats that lay down .
Some hotels have a heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners ; before the Second World War , in the 19th or early 20th centuries .
These hotels were where the rich and the famous of the day would stay , and often had fine dining and nightlife .
The old fashioned fittings , the lack of the latest amenities , and a certain graceful agedness are also part of their character .
While they are usually privately owned , they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries .
A traveller with piles of money might consider a round the world flight , broken up with stays in many of these hotels .
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they are going to visit .
Joining such a network usually just requires filling out an online form ; although some networks offer or require additional verification .
A listing of available hosts is then provided either in print and / or online , sometimes with references and reviews by other travelers .
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but did not have a place to stay .
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation .

Kerala 's temple festivals are very interesting to see , with regular procession of decorated elephants , temple orchestra and other festivities .
A World 's Fair ( commonly called World Exposition , or simply Expo ) is large international festival of arts and sciences .
Participating countries present artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to showcase world issues or their country 's culture and history .
International Horticultural Expositions are specialised events which showcase floral displays , botanical gardens and anything else to do with plants .
Although in theory they can take place annually ( so long as they are in different countries ) , in practice they are not .
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months , and are held on sites no smaller than 50 hectares .
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years . Standard 35 mm film ( 36 by 24 mm negative ) is much the commonest .
It can usually be replenished fairly easily if you run out , and gives resolution roughly comparable to a current DSLR .
Some medium @-@ format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format , more precisely a 56 by 56 mm negative .
This gives resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative ( 3136 mm2 versus 864 ) .
Wildlife is among the most challenging motifs for a photographer , and needs a combination of good luck , patience , experience and good equipment .
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted , but like photography in general , a picture is worth a thousand words .
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens , though things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other lenses .
Many exotic animals are hard to find , and parks sometimes have rules about taking photographs for commercial purposes .
Wild animals might either be shy or aggressive . The environment might be cold , hot , or otherwise hostile .
The world has over 5,000 different languages , including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers .
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words , also . This is especially true of addresses , which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly .
Many entire nations are completely fluent in English , and in even more you can expect a limited knowledge - especially among younger people .
Imagine , if you will , a Mancunian , Bostonian , Jamaican and Sydneysider sitting around a table having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto .
They 're regaling each other with stories from their hometowns , told in their distinct accents and local argot .
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to get fed . Without cooking opportunities , choices are however limited to ready @-@ made food .
Increasingly supermarkets are getting a more varied section of ready @-@ made food . Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food .
In some countries or types of stores there is at least one on @-@ site restaurant , often a rather informal one with affordable prices .
Make and carry copies of your policy and your insurer 's contact details with you .
They need to show the insurer 's e @-@ mail address and international phone numbers for advice / authorizations and making claims .
Have another copy in your luggage and online ( e @-@ mail to yourself with attachment , or stored in the " cloud " ) .
If traveling with a laptop or tablet , store a copy in its memory or disc ( accessible without the internet ) .
Also give policy / contact copies to traveling companions and relatives or friends back home willing to help .
Moose ( also known as elk ) aren 't inherently aggressive , but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat .
When people don 't see moose as potentially dangerous , they may approach too closely and put themselves at risk .
Drink alcoholic drinks with moderation . Alcohol affects everyone differently , and knowing your limit is very important .
Possible long term health events from excessive drinking can include liver damage and even blindness and death . The potential danger is increased when consuming illegally produced alcohol .
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities including methanol , which can cause blindness or death even in small doses .
Eyeglasses can be cheaper in a foreign country , especially in low @-@ income countries where labour costs are lower .
Consider getting an eye exam at home , especially if insurance covers it , and bringing the prescription along to be filed elsewhere .
High @-@ end brand @-@ name frames available in such areas may have two problems ; some may be knock @-@ offs , and the real imported ones may be more expensive than at home .
Coffee is one of the world 's most traded commodities , and you can probably find many types in your home region .
Nevertheless , there are many distinctive ways of drinking coffee around the world that are worth experiencing .
Canyoning ( or : canyoneering ) is about going in a bottom of a canyon , which is either dry or full of water .
Canyoning combines elements from swimming , climbing and jumping--but requires relatively little training or physical shape to get started ( compared to rock climbing , scuba diving or alpine skiing , for example ) .
Hiking is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments , often on hiking trails .
Day hiking involves distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be covered in a single day .

Families with small children may need more preparations , but a day outdoors is easily possible even with babies and pre @-@ school children .
Internationally , there are nearly 200 running tour organizations . Most of them operate independently .
The Global Running Tours successor , Go Running Tours networks dozens of sightrunning providers on four continents .
With roots in Barcelona 's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen 's Running Copenhagen , it was quickly joined by Running Tours Prague based in Prague and others .
There are many things you have to take into consideration before and when you travel somewhere .
When you travel , expect things not to be like they are " back home . " Manners , laws , food , traffic , lodging , standards , language and so on will to some extent differ from where you live .
This is something you always need to keep in mind , to avoid disappointment or perhaps even distaste over local ways to do things .
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century . A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which extends beyond a traveller 's previous experience of nature , culture , language or low @-@ income countries .
Although most agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings , many agents specialise in particular types of travel , budget ranges or destinations .
It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar trips to yours .
Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting , whether on a website or in a shop window .
If you want to see the world on the cheap , for necessity , lifestyle or challenge , there are some ways to do that .
Basically , they fall into two categories : Either work while you travel or try and limit your expenses . This article is focused on the latter .
For those willing to sacrifice comfort , time and predictability to push expenses down close to zero , see minimum budget travel .
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal , trespass , participate in the illegal market , beg , or otherwise exploit other people for their own gain .
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when disembarking from a plane , a ship , or another vehicle .
In some cross @-@ border trains inspections are done on the running train and you should have valid ID with you when boarding one of those trains .
On night sleeper trains , passports may be collected by the conductor so that you do not have your sleep interrupted .
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process . In some countries , you must register your presence and address where you are staying with the local authorities .
This might require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to the immigration offices .
In many countries with such a law , local hotels will handle the registration ( make sure to ask ) .
In other cases , only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register . However , this makes the law much more obscure , so find out beforehand .
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings . The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right .
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly @-@ positioned window can be a beauty to behold .
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields including urban planning , civil engineering , decorative arts , interior design and landscape design .
Given how remote many of the pueblos are , you won 't be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe .
However , nearly all of the casinos listed above serve drinks , and several of them bring in name @-@ brand entertainment ( primarily the large ones immediately surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe ) .
Beware : small @-@ town bars here are not always good places for the out @-@ of @-@ state visitor to hang out .
For one thing , northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving , and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is high close to small @-@ town bars .
Unwanted murals or scribble is known as graffiti .
While it 's far from a modern phenomenon , most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property using spray paint .
However , nowadays there are established graffiti artists , graffiti events and " legal " walls . Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble artworks rather than illegible tags .
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire .
If you want to learn throwing a boomerang that comes back to your hand , make sure you have a suitable boomerang for returning .
Most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non @-@ returning . It is best for beginners to not try throwing in windy
A Hangi Meal is cooked in a hot pit in the ground .
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire , or in some places geothermal heat makes areas of ground naturally hot .
The hangi is often used to cook a traditional roast style dinner .
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi , while other hangi can be sampled in Christchurch , Wellington and elsewhere .
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town : MetroPlus ( also called First Class ) and Metro ( called Third Class ) .
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but slightly more expensive , though still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe .
Every train has both MetroPlus and Metro coaches ; the MetroPlus coaches are always on the end of the train nearest Cape Town .
Carrying for others - Never let your bags out of your sight , especially when you are crossing international borders .
You could find yourself being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge , which will land you in a great deal of trouble .
This includes waiting in line , as drug @-@ sniffing dogs could be used at any time without notice .
Some countries have exceedingly draconian punishments even for first time offenses ; these can include prison sentences of over 10 years or death .
Unattended bags are a target for theft and can also attract attention from authorities wary of bomb threats .
At home , due to this constant exposure to the local germs , odds are very high that you 're already immune to them .
But in other parts of the world , where the bacteriological fauna are new to you , you 're far more likely to run into problems .
Also , in warmer climates bacteria both grow more quickly and survive longer outside the body .
Thus the scourges of Delhi Belly , the Pharaoh 's Curse , Montezuma 's Revenge , and their many friends .
As with respiratory problems in colder climates , intestinal problems in hot climates are fairly common and in most cases are distinctly annoying but not really dangerous .
If traveling in a developing country for the first time - or in a new part of the world - don 't underestimate the potential culture shock .
Many a stable , capable traveler has been overcome by the newness of developing world travel , where many little cultural adjustments can add up quickly .
Especially in your initial days , consider splurging on Western @-@ style and -quality hotels , food , and services to help acclimatize .
Do not sleep on a mattress or pad on the ground in areas where you do not know the local fauna .
If you are going to camp out , bring a camp cot or hammock to keep you away from snakes , scorpions and such .
Fill your home with a rich coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea at night .
When you 're on a staycation , you have the time to treat yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew up something special .
If you 're feeling more adventurous , take the opportunity to juice or blend up some smoothies :
maybe you 'll discover a simple beverage that you can make for breakfast when you 're back to your daily routine .
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture , go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don 't frequent .
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon , the words infectious and contagious have distinct meanings .
An infectious disease is one that is caused by a pathogen , such as a virus , bacterium , fungus or other parasites .
A contagious disease is a disease which is easily transmitted by being in the vicinity of an infected person .
Many governments require visitors entering , or residents leaving , their countries to be vaccinated for a range of diseases .
These requirements may often depend on what countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit .
One of strong points of Charlotte , North Carolina , is that it has an abundance of high @-@ quality options for families .
Residents from other areas often cite family @-@ friendliness as a primary reason for moving there , and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children around .
In the past 20 years , the amount of child @-@ friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially .
Taxis are not generally used by families in Charlotte , though they can be of some use in certain circumstances .
There is a surcharge for having more than 2 passengers , so this option might be more expensive than necessary .
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth , and surrounds the South Pole .
Tourist visits are costly , demand physical fitness , can only take place in summer Nov @-@ Feb , and are largely limited to the Peninsula , Islands and Ross Sea .
A couple of thousand staff live here in summer in some four dozen bases mostly in those areas ; a small number stay over winter .
Inland Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2 @-@ 3 km of ice .
Occasional specialist air tours go inland , for mountaineering or to reach the Pole , which has a large base .
The South Pole Traverse ( or Highway ) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole .
It 's compacted snow with crevasses filled in and marked by flags . It can only be traveled by specialized tractors , hauling sleds with fuel and supplies .
These aren 't very nimble so the trail has to take a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to come onto the plateau .
The most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads , pavements ( sidewalks ) and especially steps .
At a minimum , you need footwear with suitable soles . Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow , even some winter boots are deficient .
The pattern should be deep enough , 5 mm ( 1 / 5 inch ) or more , and the material soft enough in cold temperatures .
Some boots have studs and there is studded add @-@ on equipment for slippery conditions , suitable for most shoes and boots , for the heels or heels and sole .
Heels should be low and wide . Sand , gravel or salt ( calcium chloride ) is often scattered on roads or paths to improve traction .
Avalanches are not an abnormality ; steep slopes can hold only so much slow , and the excess volumes will come down as avalanches .
The problem is that snow is sticky , so it needs some triggering to come down , and some snow coming down can be the triggering event for the rest .
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow , sometimes some more snowfall , sometimes other natural events , often a human .
A tornado is a spinning column of very low @-@ pressure air , which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward .
They generate high winds ( often 100 @-@ 200 miles / hour ) and can lift heavy objects into the air , carrying them as the tornado moves .
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds , and become " tornadoes " when they touch the ground .
Personal VPN ( virtual private network ) providers are an excellent way of circumventing both political censorship and commercial IP @-@ geofiltering .
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons : They re @-@ route all Internet traffic , not only http .
They normally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service . They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on .
The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this , claiming that it is to " prevent piracy . "
In fact , region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying ; a bit @-@ for @-@ bit copy of a disk will play just fine on any device where the original will .
The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets ; it 's all about money spinning .
Because calls are routed over the Internet , you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel .
There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community in which you live ; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chicken , Alaska and select a number which claims you 're in sunny Arizona .
Often , you have to buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to call you . Where the number is from makes a difference for people calling you .
Real @-@ time text translator apps - applications that are capable of automatically translating whole segments of text from one language into another .
Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone towards those objects .
The translation engines have improved dramatically , and now often give more or less correct translations ( and more seldom gibberish ) , but some care is due , as they still may have gotten it all wrong .
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate , which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data .
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when out of your home country .
It can save money over buying new maps for a GPS , or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company .
If you don 't have a data connection for your phone , or when it is out of range , their performance can be limited or unavailable .
Every corner store is filled with a confusing array of pre @-@ paid phone cards that can be used from pay phones or ordinary telephones .
While most cards are good for calling anywhere , some specialise in providing favourable call rates to specific groups of countries .
Access to these services is often through a toll @-@ free telephone number that can be called from most phones without charge .
Rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording , possibly even more so .
If just taking a photo of something isn 't allowed , then you shouldn 't even think of recording a video of it .
If using a drone , check well in advance as to what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licensing are required .
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea , even if it 's not illegal in your area .
Nowadays air travel is only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices .
Sometimes the same flight can have vastly differing prices at various agregators and it pays to compare search results and to also look at the website of the airline itself before booking .
While you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business , going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going there just as a casual tourist .
In general , staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to obtain a visa in advance .
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures from normal tourist or business visas .
For most countries , you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at , and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course .
Check with the institution , as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements .
Unless you are a diplomat , working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in .
Income tax is structured differently in different countries , and the tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another .
In some federal countries , such as the United States and Canada , income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level , so the rates and brackets can vary from region to region .
While immigration check is usually absent or a formality when you arrive in your homeland , customs control can be a hassle .
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring in and declare anything over the legal limits .
The easiest way to get started in the business of travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website .
After you become comfortable with formatting and editing on the web , then later , you might create your own website .
Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference but it 's not just about giving .
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture , meet new people , learn about yourself , get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills .
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small salary .
Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea . Parts of these routes can still be used . Check possible need for special permits , which may be difficult to get .
The White Sea @-@ Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea , via Lake Onega , Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg , mostly by rivers and lakes .
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga , so coming from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible .
Be assured that once you hit the marinas everything will be pretty obvious . You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you .
Basically you 'll be putting up notices offering your help , pacing the docks , approaching people cleaning their yachts , trying to make contact with sailors in the bar , etc .
Try to talk to as many people as possible . After a while everyone will know you and will give you hints as to which boat is looking for someone .
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance carefully .
Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly most , you should be aware that privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline in the same alliance .
Airlines such as Emirates , Etihad Airways , Qatar Airways & Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa , and offer connections to many major African cities at competitive rates than other European airlines .
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014 .
If you have additional travel time , check to see how your total fare quote to Africa compares with a round @-@ the @-@ world fare .
Don 't forget to add in the extra costs of additional visas , departure taxes , ground transportation , etc. for all those places outside of Africa .
If you want to fly around the world completely in the Southern Hemisphere , the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes .
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere ( and SkyTeam covers none of the crossings ) .
However , Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti , which is a LATAM Oneworld flight .
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America . ( see below )
In 1994 , the ethnically Armenian Nagorno @-@ Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris .
With Armenian backing , a new republic was created . However , no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognizes it .
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to mar relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan .
The Canal District ( Dutch : Grachtengordel ) is the famous 17th @-@ century district surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam .
The whole district is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value , and its property values are among the highest of the country .
Cinque Terre , which means Five Lands , comprises the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore , Manarola , Corniglia , Vernazza and Monterosso located in the Italian region of Liguria .
They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List .
Over the centuries , people have carefully built terraces on the rugged , steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the sea .
Part of its charm is the lack of visible corporate development . Paths , trains and boats connect the villages , and cars cannot reach them from the outside .
The varieties of French which are spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France , though they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible .
In particular , the numbering system in French @-@ speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France , and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different .
Nevertheless , all French @-@ speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French in school , so they would be able to understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system .
In many parts of the world , waving is a friendly gesture , indicating " hello . "
However , in Malaysia , at least among the Malays in rural areas , it means " come over , " similar to the index finger bent toward the body , a gesture which is used in certain Western countries , and should be used only for that purpose .
Similarly , a British traveller in Spain may mistake a wave goodbye involving the palm facing the waver ( rather than the person being waved at ) as a gesture to come back .
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the intent of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating .
They are separate from lingua francas , which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for one reason or another as means of communication between speakers of other languages .
In the heat of the day , travelers can experience mirages that give the illusion of water ( or other things ) .
These can be dangerous if the traveler pursue the mirage , wasting precious energy and remaining water .
Even the hottest of deserts can become extremely cold at night . Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing .
In summer , especially , you 'll need to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to hike through the rainforest .
Even if you 're driving through the subtropical rainforest , a few seconds with the doors open while you get inside the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get in the vehicle with you .
Bird flu , or more formally avian influenza , can infect both birds and mammals .
Fewer than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans , but some of them have been fatal .
Most have involved people who work with poultry , but there is also some risk to birdwatchers .
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high , more or less even plateau .
These plateaus are often referred to as " vidde " meaning a wide , open treeless space , a boundless expanse .
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called " hei " meaning a treeless moorland often covered in heather .
The glaciers are not stable , but flow down the mountain . This will cause cracks , crevasses , which may be obscured by snow bridges .
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks can get closed .
At the edge of glaciers huge blocks break loose , fall down and perhaps jump or roll farther from the edge .
The tourist season for the hill stations generally peaks during the Indian summer .
However , they have a different kind of beauty and charm during winter , with many hill stations receiving healthy amounts of snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding .
Only a few airlines still offer bereavement fares , which slightly discount the cost of last @-@ minute funeral travel .
Airlines that offer these include Air Canada , Delta Air Lines , Lufthansa for flights originating from the U.S. or Canada , and WestJet .
In all cases , you must book by phone directly with the airline .
" We now have 4 @-@ month @-@ old mice that are non @-@ diabetic that used to be diabetic , " he added .
Dr. Ehud Ur , professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia and chair of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association cautioned that the research is still in its early days .
Like some other experts , he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured , noting that these findings have no relevance to people who already have Type 1 diabetes .
On Monday , Sara Danius , permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy , publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden the committee , unable to reach Bob Dylan directly about winning the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature , had abandoned its efforts to reach him .
Danius said , " Right now we are doing nothing . I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies . For now , that is certainly enough . "
Previously , Ring 's CEO , Jamie Siminoff , remarked the company started when his doorbell wasn 't audible from his shop in his garage .
He built a WiFi door bell , he said .
Siminoff said sales boosted after his 2013 appearance in a Shark Tank episode where the show panel declined funding the startup .
In late 2017 , Siminoff appeared on shopping television channel QVC .
Ring also settled a lawsuit with competing security company , the ADT Corporation .
While one experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality , up until now , no drugs have been clearly demonstrated suitable for treating existing infection .
One antibody cocktail , ZMapp , initially showed promise in the field , but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than sought in preventing death .
In the PALM trial , ZMapp served as a control , meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it .
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee 's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes .
We agree with the USOC 's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs , and their sport , may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization , rather than decertification .
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shine light on how abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes .
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - making the sport of gymnastics , and others , as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dreams in a safe , positive and empowered environment .
Throughout 1960s , Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and then the Lyndon B. Johnson administration .
During the 1976 selections he advised Carter on foreign policy , then served as National Security Advisor ( NSA ) from 1977 to 1981 , succeeding Henry Kissinger .
As NSA , he assisted Carter in diplomatically handling world affairs , such as the Camp David Accords , 1978 ; normalizing US @-@ China relations thought the late 1970s ; the Iranian Revolution , which led to the Iran hostage crisis , 1979 ; and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan , 1979 .

Late on Sunday , the United States President Donald Trump , in a statement delivered via the press secretary , announced US troops would be leaving Syria .
The announcement was made after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .
Turkey would also take over guarding captured ISIS fighters which , the statement said , European nations have refused to repatriate .
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers , a theory already widespread , but provides details fossils generally cannot , such as color and three @-@ dimensional arrangement .
. Scientists say this animal 's plumage was chestnut @-@ brown on top with a pale or carotenoid @-@ colored underside .
The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds .
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well @-@ developed shaft , called a rachis , but do have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features .
The feathers ' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display . The researchers suggested that , even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur , the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick 's down .
The researchers suggested that , even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur , the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick 's down .
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep , Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people .
The governor 's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers .
Police said they suspect an alleged Daesh ( ISIL ) militant of responsibility for the attack .
They found the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars : The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity , their rotation , and nothing else .
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star 's Rossby number , which is related to plasma flow .
The smaller the Rossby number , the less active the star with respect to magnetic reversals .
During his trip , Iwasaki ran into trouble on many occasions .
He was robbed by pirates , attacked in Tibet by a rabid dog , escaped marriage in Nepal and was arrested in India .
The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies .
This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a , 802.11b and 802.11g , provided that the base station has dual radios .
The speeds of 802.11n are substantially faster than that of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit / s .
Duvall , who is married with two adult children , did not leave a big impression on Miller , to whom the story was related .

" We will endeavour to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a notable margin by 2020 from the 2005 level , " Hu said .
He did not set a figure for the cuts , saying they will be made based on China 's economic output .
Hu encouraged developing countries " to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later . "
He added that " they should not , however , be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their development stage , responsibility and capabilities . "
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today .
It warns No one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare , growing violence , or a slide toward chaos .
The Report opens with plea for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States about the policy towards the Middle East .
The Report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the present policy of the Executive towards Iraq and it urges an immediate change of direction .
First among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq 's borders against hostile interventions and to re @-@ establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors .
Current senator and Argentine First Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy yesterday evening in La Plata , a city 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) away from Buenos Aires .
Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre , the same location she used to start her 2005 campaign for the Senate as member of the Buenos Aires province delegation .
The debate was sparked by controversy over spending on relief and reconstruction in the wake Hurricane Katrina ; which some fiscal conservatives have humorously labeled " Bush 's New Orleans Deal . "
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to perceived Washington insiders .
Over four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral .
The number of people present was so large that it was not possible for everybody to gain access to the funeral in St. Peter 's Square .

Ever since the Federal Government stepped in to take over funding of the Mersey hospital in Devonport , Tasmania , the state government and some federal MPs have criticised this act as a stunt in the prelude to the federal election to be called by November .
But Prime Minister John Howard has said the act was only to safeguard the facilities of the hospital from being downgraded by the Tasmanian government , in giving an extra AUD $ 45 million .
According to the latest bulletin , sea level readings indicated a tsunami was generated . There was some definite tsunami activity recorded near Pago Pago and Niue .
No major damage or injuries have been reported in Tonga , but power was temporarily lost , which reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC .
Fourteen schools in Hawaii located on or near coastlines were closed all of Wednesday despite the warnings being lifted .

The community irritation led to current efforts to draft a policy regarding sexual content for the site which hosts millions of openly @-@ licensed media .
The work done was mostly theoretical , but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy .
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy 's dark matter and the Milky Way 's dark matter .
Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth , causing tides , so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy .
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affect other dark matter in the same way regular matter does .
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo , and is made of lots of small particles .
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant .
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors , turn off air @-@ conditioners and not to drink tap water .
According to Japan 's nuclear agency , radioactive caesium and iodine has been identified at the plant .
Authorities speculate that this indicates that containers holding uranium fuel at the site may have ruptured and are leaking .
Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis ( XDR @-@ TB ) in the South African region KwaZulu @-@ Natal .
In an interview , he said the new variant was " very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate . "
Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital , Dr. Moll thinks , and at least two were hospital health workers .
In one year 's time , an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts .
However , the percentage of XDR @-@ TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low ; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa .
The satellites , both of which weighed in excess of 1,000 pounds , and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour , collided 491 miles above the Earth .
Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive .
They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the Earth will be affected .
The United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense office is tracking the debris .
The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website .

There , they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian , 53 , covered with blood @-@ stained blankets .
Police said that the body appeared to have been there for about a day .
The first cases of the disease this season were reported in late July .
The disease is carried by pigs , which then migrates to humans through mosquitos .
The outbreak has prompted the Indian government to undertake such measures as deployment of pig catchers in seriously affected areas , distributing thousands of mosquito curtains and spraying pesticides .
Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government , which will help prepare health agencies for next year .
Plans for vaccines to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low prioritisation relative to other diseases .
In 1956 Słania moved to Sweden , where three years later he began work for the Swedish Post Office and became their chief engraver .
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries .
His work is of such recognized quality and detail that he is one of the very few " household names " among philatelists . Some specialize in collecting his work alone .
His 1,000th stamp was the magnificent " Great Deeds by Swedish Kings " by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000 , which is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records .
He was also engaged in engraving banknotes for many countries , recent examples of his work including the Prime Ministerial portraits on the front of the new Canadian $ 5 and $ 100 bills .

After the dam was built in 1963 , the seasonal floods that would spread sediment throughout the river were halted .
This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and beaches , which served as wildlife habitats .
As a result , two fish species have become extinct , and two others have become endangered , including the humpback chub .
Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood , officials are hoping it will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream .
No tsunami warning has been issued , and according to the Jakarta geophysics agency , no tsunami warning will be issued because the quake did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement .

In France , voting has traditionally been a low @-@ tech experience : voters isolate themselves in a booth , put a pre @-@ printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope .
After officials verify the voter 's identity , the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll .
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the proceedings .
Since 1988 , ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters .
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process . In the evening , votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision , following specific procedures .

When you call someone who is thousands of miles away , you are using a satellite .
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down , almost instantly .
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket . Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth 's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view .
It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space .
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways . The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation .

Under them are more medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer .
Finally , there are many small cats ( including loose pet cats ) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects , rodents , lizards , and birds .
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche , a special job each cat holds that keeps it from competing with others .
Lions are the most social cats , living in large groups called prides .
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males , along with as many as thirty females and cubs .
The females are usually closely related to each other , being a large family of sisters and daughters .
Lion prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs , animals surprisingly similar to lions ( but not other big cats ) in behavior , and also very deadly to their prey .
A well rounded athlete , the tiger can climb ( though not well ) , swim , leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human .
The tiger is in the same group ( Genus Panthera ) as lions , leopards , and jaguars . These four cats are the only ones who can roar .
The tiger 's roar is not like the full @-@ voiced roar of a lion , but more like a sentence of snarly , shouted words .
Ocelots like to eat small animals . They will catch monkeys , snakes , rodents and birds if they can . Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is .
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat ( prey ) by smell , sniffing for where they 've been on the ground .
They can see very well in the dark with night vision , and move very stealthily , too . Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey .
When a small group of living things ( a small population ) gets separated from the main population that they came from ( like if they move over a mountain range or a river , or if they move to a new island so that they can 't easily move back ) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before .
This new environment has different resources and different competitors , so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they had needed before .
The original population hasn 't changed at all , they still need the same adaptations as before .
Over time , as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment , they start to look less and less like the other population .
Eventually , after thousands or even millions of years , the two populations will look so different that they can 't be called the same species .
We call this process speciation , which just means the formation of new species . Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution .
Plants make oxygen which humans breathe , and they take in carbon @-@ dioxide which humans exhale ( that is , breathe out ) .
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis . They also provide shade .
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants . Most foods that we eat are plants . Without plants , animals could not survive .
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time , so it feared nothing , except other mosasaurs .
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor @-@ sharp teeth , along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth , meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path .
We don 't know for sure , but it may have had a forked tongue . Its diet included turtles , large fish , other mosasaurs , and it may even have been a cannibal .
It also attacked anything that entered the water ; even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would be no match for it .
While most of their food would be familiar to us , Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast items , including wild boar , peacock , snails , and a type of rodent called a dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs , the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals .
Ancient Roman meals couldn 't have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries .
For instance , they didn 't have corn , nor tomatoes , nor potatoes , nor cocoa , and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey .
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god .
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals .
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter .
Sometimes special pyramid shaped towers , called ziggurats , were built to be a part of the temples .
The top of the tower was special sanctuary for the god .
In the warm climate of the Middle East , the house was not so important .

If you have watched the movie National Treasure , you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence .

While no one knows for certain who wrote it , it is known that early in its life , the large parchment document ( it measures 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches ) was rolled up for storage .
So , it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label .
The D @-@ Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France , but the south still wasn 't free .

In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany .
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work co @-@ operatively , a society .
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis , meaning civil , related to the Latin civis , meaning citizen , and civitas , meaning city or city @-@ state , and that also somehow defines the size of the society .
City @-@ states are the precursors of nations . A civilizational culture implies the passing on of knowledge across several generations , a lingering cultural footprint and fair dissemination .
Minor cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historic evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations .
During the Revolutionary War , the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation .
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes , and , because there was no national executive or judiciary , it relied on state authorities , who were often uncooperative , to enforce all its acts .
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states .
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent .

For example , the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm , which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era .
It is still produced today , but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats .
The 35mm format is actually , somewhat confusingly , 36mm in width by 24mm in height .
The aspect ratio of this format ( dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole @-@ number ratio ) is therefore said to be 3 : 2 .
Many common formats ( APS family of formats , for example ) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio .
The much @-@ abused and often @-@ ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline creating dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image .
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally ( see example ) .
During this period of European history , the Catholic Church , which had become rich and powerful , came under scrutiny .
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs . I
Its all @-@ pervading power affected everyone from king to commoner .
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason .
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this tenet was being met .
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities , Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany .
The strategy proved effective , cutting off vital military and civilian supplies , although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries .
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean , causing danger to even neutral ships .
Since there was limited response to this tactic , Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare .
During the 1920s , the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation .
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I , nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future .
In 1884 , Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City .
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name , a book of poetry , and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor ( his manager in his previous job ) to Thomas Edison .
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods ; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty .
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces . The best @-@ known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch taking place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty .
During these periods fierce warfare took place between many nobles fighting for the throne .
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient China 's history thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi 'an .
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of metric system , a shift from absolutism to republicanism , nationalism and the belief the country belongs to the people not to one sole ruler .
Also after the Revolution occupations were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed .
Same goes for the military because instead of army rankings being based on class they were now based on cailaber .
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people of other country 's to began their own revolutions .
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life . He used to frequent a cave that became known as " Hira " " on the Mountain of " Noor " ( light ) for contemplation .
he cave itself , which survived the times , gives a very vivid image of Muhammad 's spiritual inclinations .
Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca , the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world .
In fact , it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed . Once inside the cave , it is a total isolation .
Nothing can be seen other than the clear , beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains . Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave .
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today .
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE , the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaoh .
The Giza Plateau , or " Giza Necropolis " in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids ( of which the great pyramid is the largest ) , several small tombs , several temples , and the great Sphinx .
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu , and many of the smaller pyramids , tombs , and temples were built to honor Khufu 's wives and family members .
The " up bow " mark looks like a V and the " down bow mark " like a staple or a square missing its bottom side .
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow , and down means you should start at the frog ( which is where your hand is holding the bow ) and pull the bow .
An up @-@ bow usually generates a softer sound , while a down @-@ bow is stronger and more assertive .
Feel free to pencil in your own marks , but remember the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason , so they should usually be respected .
The terrified King Louis XVI , Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children ( 11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis @-@ Charles ) and the King 's sister , Madam Elizabeth , on the 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women .
In a carriage , they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen .
The mob of people forced the King And Queen to have their carriage windows wide open .
At one point a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen .
The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves .
They were compelled to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a major part of the expenditures and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses .
Of course , the superprofits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism .
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order .
The age where the events took place is commonly referred as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries ( AD 1000 @-@ 1300 ) .
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages , which by convention ends around 1500 .
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice , from technology @-@ push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology .
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas : that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence , and that technology in turn has " effects " on societies that are inherent , rather than socially conditioned .
For example , one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads .
However , a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars , so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership .
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads , which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies .
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism , drawn from writers such as Goethe , Fichte , and Schlegel .
In the context of Romanticism , the geography molded individuals , and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose , and these , being in harmony with the place of the society , were better than arbitrarily imposed laws .
In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world , Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe .
Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted up until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued more than what Byzantine markets offered .
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made .
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century .
At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east .
However , due to the slow communication channels , styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 year .
towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades people began to use buttons to fasten clothing .
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agriculturalist and his / her family .
Subsistence agriculture is a simple , often organic , system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield .
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations .
Subcultures bring together like @-@ minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity .
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age , ethnicity , class , location , and / or gender of the members .
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic , aesthetic , religious , political , sexual , geographical , or a combination of factors .
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style , which includes fashions , mannerisms , and argot .
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were , through neglect , misfortune , or wilful abuse , not socialized by adults while they were growing up .
Such children are called " feral " or wild . Some feral children have been confined by people ( usually their own parents ) ; in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents ' rejection of a child 's severe intellectual or physical impairment .
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away .
Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals ; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own .
When completely brought up by non @-@ human animals , the feral child exhibits behaviors ( within physical limits ) almost entirely like those of the particular care @-@ animal , such as its fear of or indifference to humans .
While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting , scaffolding goes a step beyond .
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project .
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real , in other words , a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office .
Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question , prompt , and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone .
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect , to abuse , and even to extortion .
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing , caring , and educational , but they do .
We perceive the Foster Care System to be a safety zone for these children .
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes , loving caregivers , stable education , and reliable health care .
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from .
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication .
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach .
For example , " learning " and " socialization " are suggested as important motivations for Internet use ( James et al . , 1995 ) .
" Personal involvement " and " continuing relationships " were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord ( 1998 ) when they investigated audience reactions to websites .
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro @-@ expressions , facial movements which last a few milliseconds .
In particular , it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro @-@ expressions correctly .
Oliver Sacks , in his paper The President 's Speech , indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately .
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs .
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation : hidden and expressed .
Mutation adds new genetic variation , and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation .
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation .
Out on the savanna , it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino @-@ acid requirements from available plant resources .
Moreover , failure to do so has serious consequences : growth depression , malnutrition , and ultimately death .
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes , but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked .
In contrast , animal foods ( ants , termites , eggs ) not only are easily digestible , but they provide high @-@ quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids .
All things considered , we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their " protein problem " in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today .
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later ( 10 @-@ 60 minutes ) .
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you .
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep , it can be placed on the other side of the room , forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off .
Other biorhythm @-@ based options involve drinking lots of fluid ( particularly water or tea , a known diuretic ) prior to sleep , forcing one to get up to urinate .
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in one 's body and spirit .
The lower the tension , the more positive the life force present . Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment .
Everyone can achieve enlightenment . The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity .
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha , but were extended by the mahayana path of love and by a lot of techniques from Indian Yoga .
In principle the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple . It consists of Kundalini Yoga , meditation and the path of all @-@ embracing love .
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy ( enlightenment energy ) is awakened through yoga postures , breathing exercises , mantras and visualizations .
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga . Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleaned , the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created .
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2 , leading to cooperation between the USSR and USA . With the end of the war the clashes of system , process and culture led to the countries falling out .
With two years of the end of the war , the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began .
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real , by proxy armies , on battlefields from Africa to Asia , in Afghanistan , Cuba and many other places .
By September 17 , 1939 , the Polish defense was already broken , and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead .
However , these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight , when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet 's Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty , the Soviet @-@ Polish Non @-@ Aggression Pact , and other international treaties , both bilateral and multilateral .
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans .
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods , while at the same time , interfering with your enemy 's ability to move his people and goods .
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII . The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain .
At the same time , the German navy , using mainly U @-@ boats , was trying to stop this traffic .
Had the Allies failed , Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe .
Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran .
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk , hair , meat , and skins .
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas , often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents , similar to the more widely known shepherd . These methods of herding are still used today .
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century .
Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood , they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day .
Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place . Gradually , however , it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top .
This became common practice , but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons .
Eventually , wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels . In 1767 , the first full @-@ iron rails were introduced .
The first known transportation was walking , humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus ( meaning upright man ) .
Their predecessors , the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually .
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 @-@ 3.9 million years ago , although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago .
We can start living more friendly to the environment , we can join to the environmental movement , and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree .
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases . However , if we do not only want a temporary solution , then we should find the root of the problems , and we should deactivate them .
It is obvious enough that the world has changed much because of humankind 's scientific and technological advancements , and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mankind 's extravagant lifestyle .
After its adoption by Congress on July 4 , a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap .
Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made , now known as " Dunlap broadsides . "
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8 .
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 , who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9 . A copy reached London on August 10 .
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document . The original handwritten copy has not survived .
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today . We call them birds .
Many people don 't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly .
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur .
They have feet with scales and claws , they lay eggs , and they walk on their two back legs like a T @-@ Rex .
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is coded in the form of binary numbers .
A binary number can have only one of two values , i.e. 0 or 1 , and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits , to use computer jargon .
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent . Symptoms , such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made .
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals .
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison .
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects .
This term derives from ancient familiarity with Bed @-@ bugs , which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans .
Both Assassin @-@ bugs and Bed @-@ bugs are nidicolous , adapted to living in nest or housing of their host .
Across the United States of America , there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle aged adults .
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system , which is made up of the brain , the spinal cord and the optic nerve .
Research has found that females are two times more likely to have MS then males .
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest , or in the interest of their child , to raise a baby .
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby .
In an adoption , the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may parent the child .
Science 's main goal is to figure out the way the world works through the scientific method . This method in fact guides most scientific research .
It isn 't alone though , experimentation , and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses , asking questions , and making observations also guide scientific research .
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and , in particular , on the Bible in Latin .
Accepted were Aristotle 's views on all matters of science , including psychology .
As knowledge of Greek declined , the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots .
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks .
Periodic rhythms , which are not simply responses to external periodic cues , have been documented for most living beings , including bacteria , fungi , plants , and animals .
Biological clocks are self sustaining oscillators which will continue a period of free @-@ running cycling even in the absence of external cues .
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material .
Hershey and Chase used phages , or viruses , to implant their own DNA into a bacterium .
They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur .
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation , the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ @-@ line cells .
Only mutations in germ @-@ line cells can be passed on to children , while mutations elsewhere can cause cell @-@ death or cancer .
Nature @-@ based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery , including plant and animal wildlife .
Examples of on @-@ site activities include hunting , fishing , photography , bird watching , and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem .
An example is visiting , photographing , and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo .
Every morning , people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left .
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with , and supporting , a transport system based on private cars .
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years .
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems . Almost everyone complains about transportation systems .
In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down .
Why do transportation systems engender such complaints , why do they fail on a daily basis ? Are transportation engineers just incompetent ? Or is something more fundamental going on ?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another .
Unfortunately , studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one @-@ hundred percent certainty .
Fortunately , drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range ; thus , traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically .
To better represent traffic flow , relationships have been established between the three main characteristics : ( 1 ) flow , ( 2 ) density , and ( 3 ) velocity .
These relationships help in planning , design , and operations of roadway facilities .
Insects were the first animals to take to the air . Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently .
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body .
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators .
Today , the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and mayflies .
Thousands of years ago , a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun .
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite ; that the Solar System moved around the Earth , including the Sun ( and even the other stars ) .
This seems sensible , because the Earth doesn 't feel as if it 's moving , does it ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth . It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second biggest river .
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth , at times six miles wide .
A full 20 percent of the water that pours out of the planet 's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon .
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km ( 3,980 miles ) . It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers .
Although pyramid @-@ building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom , the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction .
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians marvelled at their predecessors monuments , which were then well over a thousand year old .
Vatican City 's population is around 800 . It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population .
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications .
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies .
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic .
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold , silver , and copper from antiquity , as these can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools .
Aristotle , a philosopher , theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements . They were earth , water , air , and fire .
This was more like the four states of matter ( in the same order ) : solid , liquid , gas , and plasma , though he also theorised that they change into new substances to form what we see .
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals . Don 't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table .
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals . Of course , there are also metals like silver and gold .
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non @-@ metallic elements like carbon .
Everything in the Universe is made of matter . All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms .
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence .
Thus , the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out .
Sadly , as newer methods of writing have emerged , the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses .
People now write messages on computer screens , never having to come close to a sharpener .
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along .
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons .
Sort of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill . Splitting the nucleus up again then releases some of that energy .
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no nudging .
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust . The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust .
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side .
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands .
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner . It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface .
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people tick or appeals to them .
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires which have been internalized as they mature to adulthood .
These theories look at what it is about certain people that make them want the things that they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things .
Two popular content theories are Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg 's Two Factor Theory .
Generally speaking , two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers . One end of the spectrum is trying to remain " one of the guys " ( or gals ) .
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions , performing disciplinary action , performance evaluations , assigning responsibility , and holding people accountable .
At the other end of the spectrum , one morphs into an unrecognizable individual that feels he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own .
After all , the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team .
This behavior oftentimes results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team .
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams , but there are subtle differences .
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group .
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to varying time zones which may not be understood by their local management .
The presence of a true " invisible team " ( Larson and LaFasto , 1989 , p109 ) is also a unique component of a virtual team .
The " invisible team " is the management team to which each of the members report . The invisible team sets the standards for each member .
Why would an organization want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization ? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation .
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization , creativity and ingenuity can transpire .
As a result , the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer 's need .
Before an organization can be innovative , leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning .
Angel ( 2006 ) , explains the Continuum approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance .
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition . Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact .
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research .
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage , traumas , lesions , and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions .
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before .
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind .
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction , AI forms a very important branch of computer science , dealing with behavior , learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine .
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior .
Examples include control , planning and scheduling , the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions , as well as handwriting recognition , voice and face .
Such things have become separate disciplines , which focus on providing solutions to real life problems .
The AI ​ ​ system is now often used in the fields of economics , medicine , engineering and the military , as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications .
Field trips are a large part of any classroom . Quite often a teacher would love to take her students places to which a bus trip is not an option .
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips . Students can look at museum artifacts , visit an aquarium , or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class .
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes .
For example , each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital , each year the website gets remodeled , but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook .
Blogs can also help improve student writing . While students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling , the presence of an audience generally changes that .
Since students are often the most critical audience , the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism .
Also blogging " forces students to become more savvy about the world around them . " The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting ( Toto , 2004 ) .
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration , and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day .
Appropriate use of blogs " can empower students to become more analytical and critical ; through actively responding to Internet materials , students can define their positions in the context of others ' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues ( Oravec , 2002 ) .
Ottawa is Canada 's charming , bilingual capital and features an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada 's past and present .
Farther south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond .
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders .
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some is nearly uninhabited wilderness .
For a comparison of population that surprises many : There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens .
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa .
Madagascar is by far the biggest , and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife .
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations , or associated with France , and known as luxury beach resorts .
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands , and it took in a big way in the Comoros and Mayotte .
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century , as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India .
In the north the region is bounded by the Sahel , and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean .
Women : It is recommended that any women travellers say that they are married , regardless of actual marital status .
It is helpful to also wear a ring ( just not one that looks too expensive .
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what they would consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed , grabbed by the arm , etc .
Be firm in turning down men , and don 't be afraid to stand your ground ( cultural differences or not , it doesn 't make it ok ! ) .
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE , and was used by the Phoenicians , Romans , and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa .
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca , only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755 .
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l @-@ Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there .
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco .
Around the old Medina it 's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods , such as tagines , pottery , leather goods , hookahs , and a whole spectrum of geegaws , but it 's all for the tourists .
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda .
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the town 's streets , particularly the town centre .
While Goma is reasonably safe , any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province .
The city is also the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa .
You can use boda @-@ boda ( motorcycle taxi ) to get around Goma . The normal ( local ) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride .
Combined with its relative inaccessibility , " Timbuktu " has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic , distant lands .
Today , Timbuktu is an impoverished town , although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction , and it has an airport .
In 1990 , it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger , due to the threat of desert sands .
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates ' PBS special Wonders of the African World .
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country 's cities , because it has more of an Arabic flair than of an African .
The Kruger National Park ( KNP ) lies in the north @-@ east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east , Zimbabwe in the north , and the southern border is the Crocodile River .
The park covers 19,500 km ² and is divided in 14 different ecozones , each supporting different wildlife .
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks ( SANParks ) .
As with all South African National Parks , there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park .
It may also be beneficial for one to buy a Wild Card , which provides entry to either selections of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks .
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus .
The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour .
To get the best views of Hong Kong , leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite .
The great majority of Hong Kong Island 's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore .
This is the place the British colonisers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory 's colonial past , this is a good place to start .
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world , stretching 80 km ( 50 mi ) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast .
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park .
The forests aren 't just mangrove swamps though - they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles which once covered the Gangetic plain .
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km ² , of which about one @-@ third is covered in water / marsh areas .
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary , and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area .
Buses depart the inter @-@ district bus station ( across the river ) throughout the day , though most , especially those heading to the east and Jakar / Bumthang leave between 06 : 30 and 07 : 30 .
As the inter @-@ district buses are often full , it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance .
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses , which are comfortable and sturdy .
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means to travel to nearby places , such as Paro ( Nu 150 ) and Punakha ( Nu 200 ) .
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable @-@ stayed bridge . It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint @-@ Georges de l 'Oyapock in French Guiana .
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters , it 's 378 meters long and it has two lanes of 3.50 m wide .
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters . Construction was completed in August 2011 , it didn 't open to traffic until March 2017 .
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 , when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be finished .
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay , living as semi @-@ nomadic hunters who also practised subsistence agriculture .
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá , who survived by hunting , gathering and fishing .
In the 16th century Paraguay , formerly called " The Giant Province of the Indies , " was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups .
The Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three centuries .
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537 , Paraguay has managed to keep a lot of its indigenous character and identity .
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world .
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas .
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year .
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches , check Asociacion Argentina de Polo .
The official Falklands currency is the Falkland pound ( FKP ) whose value is set equivalent to that of one British pound ( GBP ) .
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store .
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted .
On the outlying islands credit cards will probably not be accepted , although British and United States currency may be taken ; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method .
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands , so exchange money prior to leaving the islands .
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator , it is summer there when it 's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa .
Montevideo is in the subtropics ; in the summer months , temperatures above + 30 ° C are common .
The winter can be deceptively chilly : temperatures rarely go below freezing , but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says .
There are no particular " rainy " and " dry " seasons : the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year .
Though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans , the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed .
According to park authorities , stay at least 100 yards / meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards / meters from all other wild animals !
No matter how docile they may look , bison , elk , moose , bears , and nearly all large animals can attack .
Each year , dozens of visitors are injured because they didn 't keep a proper distance . These animals are large , wild , and potentially dangerous , so give them their space .
In addition , be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife , so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean camp .
Apia is the capital of Samoa . The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 .
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959 .
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany , the US , and Britain refused to leave the harbor .
All the ships were sunk , except for one British cruiser . Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost .
During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement , a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III .
There are many beaches , due to Auckland 's straddling of two harbours . The most popular ones are in three areas .
North Shore beaches ( in North Harbour district ) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south .
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming , and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees .
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour , in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland .
These are sometimes @-@ crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore . Swimming is safe .
The main local beer is ' Number One ' , it is not a complex beer , but pleasant and refreshing . The other local beer is called " Manta . "
There are many French wines to be had , but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better .
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink , but bottled water is easy to find if you are fearful .
For Australians , the idea of ' flat white ' coffee is foreign . A short black is ' espresso ' , cappuccino comes heaped high with cream ( not froth ) , and tea is served without milk .
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards . Fruit juices are pricey but excellent .
Many trips to the reef are made all year around , and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare .
Still , take advice from authorities , obey all signs , and pay close attention to safety warnings .
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770 . They can occasionally be found outside these times .
Sharks do exist , however they rarely attack humans . Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away .
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean , their primary habitat is in river estuaries north from Rockhampton .
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination .
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels , although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation , like camping grounds , through a travel agent .
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast , transportation arrangements to / from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages .
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or procure other documents for your destination ( e.g. visa ) .
Any amendments or requests though should be coursed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel .
For some festivals , the vast majority of the attendants to music festivals decide to camp on site , and most attendants consider it a vital part of the experience .
If you want to be close to the action you 're going to have to get in early to get a camping site close to the music .
Remember that even though music on the main stages may have finished , there may be sections of the festival that will keep playing music until late into the night .
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children .
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter , check the cabin location , as going through ice causes quite horrible noise for those most affected .
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in town . Cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements ( check the terms ) .
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize time and money spent by guests . Windows and clocks are usually absent , and exits can be hard to find .
They usually have special food , drink and entertainment offers , to keep guests in a good mood , and keep them at the premise .
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house . However , drunkenness impairs judgement , and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober .
Anyone who 's going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow , ice , or freezing temperatures .
On icy and snowy roadways , friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt .
During blizzards , enough snow to get you stuck can fall in very little time .
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows .
On the other hand , icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries , and traffic goes on mostly uninterrupted all year round .
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourism draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors .
The term safari in popular use refers to overland travel to view the stunning African wildlife , particularly on savanna .
Some animals , such as elephants and giraffes , tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing .
Lions , cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars .
A walking safari ( also called a " bush walk , " " hiking safari , " or going " footing " ) consists of hiking , either for a few hours or several days .
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021 . Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan .
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics , having hosted the games in 1964 .
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced , you may have a tricky situation .
Cancellation policies vary , but as of late March most coronavirus @-@ based cancellation policies don 't extend to July 2020 , when the Olympics had been scheduled .
It 's expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000 , with typical tickets costing around ¥ 7,000 .
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry . Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan , even if one is not present in the room .
If an iron isn 't available , or if you don 't fancy wearing ironed socks , then you can try using a hairdryer , if available .
Be careful not to allow fabric to become too hot ( which can cause shrinkage , or in extreme cases , scorch ) .
There are different ways of purifying water , some more effective against specific threats .
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough , in others several minutes are needed .
Filters vary in effectiveness , and should you have a concern , then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company .
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions .
Pests can spoil food , cause irritation , or in a worse case cause allergic reactions , spread venom , or transmit infections .
Infectious diseases themselves , or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force , do not usually qualify as pests .
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempted from taxes and excises at certain locations .
Travellers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money , especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco .
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo @-@ Pittsburgh Highway , passing frequently through isolated backwoods terrain .
If you 're not used to driving on country roads , keep your wits about you : steep grades , narrow lanes , and sharp curves predominate .
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35 @-@ 40 mph ( 56 @-@ 64 km / h ) - and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise .
Curiously , though , mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route , e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds .
German pastries are quite good , and in Bavaria , are quite rich and varied , similar to those of their southern neighbor , Austria .
Fruit pastries are common , with apples cooked into pastries year round , and cherries and plums making their appearances during the summer .
Many German baked goods also feature almonds , hazelnuts , and other tree nuts . Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee .
If you want some small though rich pastries , try what depending on region are called Berliner , Pfannkuchen or Krapfen .
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices , together with either meat or vegetables .
A curry can be either " dry " or " wet " depending on the amount of liquid .
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan , yogurt is commonly used in curries ; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent , coconut milk is commonly used .
With 17,000 islands to choose from , Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a vast variety of regional cuisines found across the nation .
But , if used without further qualifiers , the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java .
Now widely available throughout the archipelago , Javanese cuisine features an array of simply seasoned dishes , the predominant flavorings the Javanese favor being peanuts , chillies , sugar ( especially Javanese coconut sugar ) and various aromatic spices .
Stirrups are supports for the rider 's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle .
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider 's feet to get stuck in them .
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup , they could be dragged if the horse runs away . To minimize this risk , a number of safety precautions can be taken .
First , most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth , quite narrow , sole .
Next , some saddles , particularly English saddles , have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider .
Cochamó Valley - Chile 's premier climbing destination , known as the Yosemite of South America , with a variety of granite big walls and crags .
Summits include breath @-@ taking views from peaks . Climbers from all parts of the world are continually establishing new routes amongst its endless potential of walls .
Downhill snowsports , which include skiing and snowboarding , are popular sports involving sliding down snow @-@ covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet .
Skiing is a major travelling activity with many enthusiasts , occasionally known as " ski bums , " planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location .
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC !
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century , and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia .
Backpacking by ski : This activity is also called backcountry ski , ski touring or ski hiking .
It is related to but usually not involving alpine style ski touring or mountaineering , the latter ones done in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots .
Think of the skiing route as of a similar hiking route .
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking - but only very seldom you will get the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack in groomed tracks .
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries . Under normal circumstances , travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times .
The Schengen zone , however , works somewhat like one country in this respect .
As long as you stay in this zone , you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again .
Similarly , by having a Schengen visa , you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member countries separately , hence saving time , money and paperwork .
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques . Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques .
The definition has geographic variations , where the age limit might be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe .
Handicraft products might be defined as antiques , though they are younger than similar mass @-@ produced goods .
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is important also for many with other professions .
Even traditionally , though , not all Sámi have been involved in big scale reindeer husbandry , but lived from fishing , hunting and similar , having reindeer mostly as draft animals .
Today many Sámi work in modern trades . Tourism is an important income in Sápmi , the Sámi area .
Though it is widely used , especially among non @-@ Romani , the word " Gypsy " is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people .
If the country you will be visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory , your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected .
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own , but their advice is designed for their citizens .
As one example , American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations from Europeans or Arabs .
Advisories are merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country .
The views presented are often cursory , general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere .
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage , serious social disruption , or loss of human life .
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world , and there are different types of it , which can depend on geography , topography , and atmospheric conditions .
High winds , hail , excessive precipitation , and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather , as are thunderstorms , tornadoes , waterspouts , and cyclones .
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards , snowstorms , ice storms , and dust storms .
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans .
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should get professional training .
A search of the Internet for ' Hostile environment course ' will probably provide the address of a local company .
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in far greater detail , usually with practical experience .
A course will normally be from 2 @-@ 5 days and will involve role play , a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training .
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common , but publications dealing with war zones are few .
Voyagers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they 're carrying valid documents for the return trip .
The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender not stated ( X ) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies .
Willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is just as widely variable .
Searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post @-@ September 11 , 2001 era .
Pre @-@ operative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact .
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off the beach , often at a reef or similar .
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated at a few deeper sections , and a fast current to deep water may form there .
Most deaths happen as result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current , which may be impossible .
As soon as you get out of the current , swimming back is no more difficult than normally .
Try aiming somewhere where you are not caught again or , depending on your skills and on whether you have been noticed , you might want to wait for rescue .
Re @-@ entry shock comes on sooner than culture shock ( there 's less of a honeymoon phase ) , lasts longer , and can be more severe .
Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture .
When returning home after living abroad , you 've adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture .
When you went abroad at first , people were probably patient and understanding , knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt .
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home .
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids .
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins .
Usually you always here the sound of tourists and vendors . The story of the sound and light is just like a story book .
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story .
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up .
South Shetland Islands , discovered in 1819 , are claimed by several nations and have the most bases , with sixteen active in 2020 .
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Peninsula . The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas .
Others include Livingston Island , and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still @-@ active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour .
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula , bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea .
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau , then re @-@ emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains , bisected by the Minnesota Glacier .
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica 's highest mountains , the Vinson Massif , peaking at 4892 m Mount Vinson .
In remote locations , without cell phone coverage , a satellite phone may be your only option .
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone , as you have to be outdoors with clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call .
The service is frequently used by shipping , including pleasure craft , as well as expeditions who have remote data and voice needs .
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service .
An increasingly more popular option for those planning a gap @-@ year is to travel and learn .
This is especially popular with school leavers , allowing them to take a year out before university , without compromising their education .
In many cases , enrolling on a gap @-@ year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country .
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs .
Finland is a great boating destination . The " Land of a thousand lakes " has thousands of islands too , in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos .
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht .
Although the coastal archipelagos and the biggest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht , smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience .
Boating is a national pastime in Finland , with a boat to every seven or eight people .
This is matched by Norway , Sweden and New Zealand , but otherwise quite unique ( e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty ) .
Most of the distinct Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg , Russia .
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night .
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions you will not need a separate visa ( as of 2009 ) .
Some cruises feature Berlin , Germany in the brochures . As you can see from the map above Berlin is no where near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise .
Travelling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds , particularly if they 've not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event .
It is not something to be ashamed of : it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that very many people have .
For some , understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on not being in control .
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly . Frequently , time is very important with business documents , merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair .
On some routes , the larger companies have their own planes , but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem .
If they sent things by air freight , on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs .
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage . Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger , which is where you come in .
The obvious way of flying in first or business class is to fork out a thick wad of money for the privilege ( or , better yet , get your company to do it for you ) .
However , this does not come cheap : as rough rules of thumb , you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business , and eleven times for first class !
Generally speaking , there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first @-@ class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and in comfort , and charge accordingly .
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău . The local language is Romanian , but Russian is widely used .
Moldova is a multi @-@ ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict .
In 1994 , this conflict led to the creation of the self @-@ proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova , which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country .
Economic links have been re @-@ established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations .
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian .
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million , the second biggest port after Istanbul , and a very good transport hub .
Once the ancient city of Smyrna , it is now a modern , developed , and busy commercial center , set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains .
The broad boulevards , glass @-@ fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red @-@ tiled roofs , the 18th century market , and old mosques and churches , although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey .
The village of Haldarsvík offer views of the nearby island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church .
In the churchyard , there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombs .
It 's worth half an hour to stroll about the intriguing village .
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra and which was made famous to foreigners after a glowing account of its splendours recorded by Lord Byron .
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra , stopping at Cabo da Roca .
Also to the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima ( Shrine ) , a place of worldwide famous Marian apparitions .
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site , as well as a site that has an almost incalculable meaning to a significant portion of the world 's population .
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here , and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there , Jews and non @-@ Jews alike .
Please treat the site with all of the dignity , solemnity and respect it deserves . Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis .
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures .
Barcelona 's official languages are Catalan and Spanish . About a half prefer to speak Catalan , a vast majority understands it , and virtually everyone knows Spanish .
However , most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language .
Yet , Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities .
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan , but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish , English , French , Arabic and Japanese .
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric , rude and arrogant .
While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype , the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior , acting like someone who is " bien élevé " ( well brought up ) . It will make getting about considerably easier .
Parisians ' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies .
The Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested , mainly with beech , spruce , and fir trees , and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation .
It has a notably wide variety of plant communities , due to its range of microclimates , differing soils and varying levels of altitude .
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species .
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear , wolf , eagle , owl , lynx , wild cat and capercaillie can be found there , along with many more common species
While visiting the monasteries , women are required to wear skirts covering the knees and have their shoulders covered , too .
Most of the monasteries do provide wraps for women who come unprepared , but if you bring your own , especially one with bright colors , you 'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance .
Along the same line , men are required to wear trousers covering the knees .
This too can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but that clothing isn 't washed after every user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts . One size fits all for men !
Majorcan cuisine , like that of similar zones in the Mediterranean , is based on bread , vegetables and meat ( specially pork ) , and uses olive oil throughout .
A simple popular dinner , especially during the summer , is the Pa amb Oli : Bread with olive oil , tomato , and any available condiments such as cheese , tunafish , etc .
All nouns , alongside the word Sie for you , always begin with a capital letter , even in the middle of a sentence .
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects .
It also arguably makes reading easier , though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form .
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian since most words are pronounced exactly how they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g , since their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel .
Also , make sure to pronounce r and rr differently : caro means dear , whereas carro means chariot .
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar .
Therefore , reading this grammar primer would help you learn much about Persian grammar and understand phrases better .
Needless to say , if you know a Romance language , it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese .
However , people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it need not be studied separately .
Pre @-@ modern observatories are usually obsolete today , and remain as museums , or sites of education .
As light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem it is today , they are usually located in cities or at campuses , easier to reach than those built in modern times .
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions .
Cherry blossom viewing , known as hanami , has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century .
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice .
In Japan , the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court .
Plants look their best when in a natural environment , so resist the temptation to remove even " just one " specimen .
If visiting a formally arranged garden , collecting " specimens " is also going to get you ejected , without discussion .
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate , and you can buy almost anything after arriving .
But being placed in the " high tropics " just a few degrees north of equator you will need to deal with both heat ( always ) and strong sun ( when the sky is clear , more rarely ) .
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron , the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and their wives .
